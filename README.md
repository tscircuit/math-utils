# @tscircuit/math-utils

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript utility functions for geometric calculations, primarily focused on line intersection and distance calculations.

## Features

- Line intersection detection
- Segment intersection detection
- Segment-rectangle intersection detection
- Point-to-segment distance calculation
- Orientation of points
- Distance between points
- Bounds overlap and distance calculations

## Installation

```bash
bun add @tscircuit/math-utils
```

## Usage

Import the functions you need in your TypeScript project:

```typescript
import {
  doesLineIntersectLine,
  doSegmentsIntersect,
  pointToSegmentDistance,
} from "./src/index"

// Example usage
const point1 = { x: 0, y: 0 }
const point2 = { x: 5, y: 5 }
const point3 = { x: 0, y: 5 }
const point4 = { x: 5, y: 0 }

const intersects = doesLineIntersectLine([point1, point2], [point3, point4])
console.log("Lines intersect:", intersects)
```

`rect` objects passed to these helpers can either specify a `center` along with `width` and `height` or provide `Bounds` directly.
